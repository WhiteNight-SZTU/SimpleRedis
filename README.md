# SimpleString
A tool for bulk adding String to Redis , based on WinUI3.  
向Redis数据库中批量添加String的WinUI3程序。


However, i was trying to build a visual tool that no only allow user to bulk adding String, which also supported user to add List, HashList and more.  
But for me, as a beginner of WinUI3 and Redis, this is a big project and it will take too long, so perhaps I will update the relevant features in the future, or maybe not.  


# Main feature
1. Bulk Add String.
2. Customize your application background.
3. __Write a .json file to Redis.__(View AppData/RedisKey.json for more information)  

# Requirement
1. Redis server.
2. .net 6.0 framework desktop runtime.
