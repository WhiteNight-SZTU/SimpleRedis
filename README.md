# SimpleString
However, i was trying to build a visual tool that no only allow user to bulk adding String, which also
supported user to add List, HashList and more. But for me, as a beginner of WinUI3 and Redis, this is a 
big project and it will take too long, so perhaps I will update the relevant features in the future, or maybe not.

# Requirement
1. Redis server.
2. .net 6.0 framework desktop runtime.

# Main feature
1. Bulk Add String.
2. Customize your application background.

# About
Mainly for those beginner of WinUI3 and Redis.
